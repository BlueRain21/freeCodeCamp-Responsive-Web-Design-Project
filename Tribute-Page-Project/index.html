            <h3><b>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</b></h3>
            <div id="list">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Creco, Iowa</li>
                    <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                        Depression
                        era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                    <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation
                        Corps,
                        helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on
                        me."
                    </li>
                    <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Services.</li>
                    <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts.
                        Inspired by
                        Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                        pest-resistent plants.</li>
                    <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.
                        Instead, the military asked his lab to work in waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                        disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                    <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
                    <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
                        flies
                        to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                        diffrent strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
                        climate
                        on Earth.</li>
                    <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yeilds.</li>
                    <li><b>1953</b> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American breed,
                        creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexio's wheat.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yeilding strains of wheat to the Indian
                        subcontinent
                        in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.</li>
                    <li><b>1970</b> - Recives the Noble Peace Prize.</li>
                    <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum
                        yields.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University.</li>
                    <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                        genetically
                        modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says thaat
                        GM
                        crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals
                        for
                        a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                    <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
